# camel-rest-demo
A demonstration of Apache Camels REST capabilities

Build server with

>mvn clean install -P server

Build client with 

>mvn clean install -P client

Run either with 
>java -jar  target\camel-rest-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

(if you want to run both at the same time, you will have to build one, move the result and then build the other)
